  pointing to the in or outside of the object. Returns a list of boolean
  variables where each index defines wether the associated polygon's
  normal is pointing into the right direction or not.

  The algorithm works best on completely closed shapes with one
  segment only. The PolygonObject should also be valid, therefore not
  more than two polygons per edge, etc. The results might be incorrect
  with an invalid mesh structure.

  :param op: The :class:`c4d.PolygonObject` instance to test.
  :param info: A :class:`~nr.c4d.utils.PolygonObjectInfo` instance for
    the passed object, or None to generate on demand. If an info object
    is passed, it must support the following data: ``polygons``,
    ``normals`` and ``midpoints``.
  :param logger: An object implementing the logger interface. This
    is optional and only use for debug purposes.

    object that was passed or has been generated. '''
